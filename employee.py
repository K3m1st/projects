'''Create Employee Login
You have been contracted to create an employee portal for the company's new timecard system. Start by creating an Employee class with the following attibutes:

 - First Name
 - Last Name
 - Username
 - Password
 - Time Worked
 
**Requirements:**
 - prompt the user to enter the employee's first and last name
 - the init method should create an employee object with a users first and last name
 - the init method will generate the employee's username and password
 - the employee username is automatically created using the first letter of first name + '_' + first 3 letters of last name
 - the password is randomly generated, has a length of 8 - 16 characters and contains the following: at least 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, 1 number between [0-9] (i.e. running the program multiple times should produce passwords with no repeatable patterns)
 - the timecard will start at 0 minutes worked for all days of the week ''''
